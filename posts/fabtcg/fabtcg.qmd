I made this poster for my Data Engineering course, and it is meant to showcase some simple analysis made possible by a database that I had created using PostgreSQL. The entity relationship diagram at the bottom of the poster outlines the structure of that database, which stored data about cards from a trading card game called Flesh and Blood. I designed the database in a way that demonstrated my understanding of joins as well as primary and foreign keys.
