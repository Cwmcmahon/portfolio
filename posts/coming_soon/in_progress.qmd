I just added this page, but I'll be updating it with some of my in-progress projects shortly! Those will include machine learning projects, as well as projects utilizing WebR.

```{webr-r}
say_hello = function(name) {
  msg = paste0("Hello ", name, "! Isn't WebR neat?")
  return(msg)
}

# Put your name here!
say_hello("")
```
