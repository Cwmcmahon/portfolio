I am a recent graduate from Willamette University's MS in Data Science program, and before that I graduated from Willamette's College of Arts and Sciences with a BA in History. Through my MSDS program I have become proficient with tools including PostgreSQL, R (ggplot2, tidymodels, shiny, others), and Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn). Additionally, my background in history helps me bring a different perspective, good research questions, and solid writing skills to my data science projects.

For some more info about me, here are 2 truths and 1 lie:

-   I am a second degree black belt in Taekwondo

-   My third favorite movie is The Nice Guys (2016)

-   I shook President Jimmy Carter's hand

I am looking for a job at the moment, so if you are a potential employer interested in hiring me please reach out to me at my [email address](carterwmcmahon@gmail.com). If you do, I'd be happy to tell you which one of the three statements from above is a lie!
