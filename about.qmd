I am a recent graduate from Willamette University's MS in Data Science program, and before that I graduated from Willamette's College of Arts and Sciences with a BA in History. Through my MSDS program I have become proficient with tools including PostgreSQL, R, and Python. Some specific packages I have used in my work are ggplot2, tidymodels, shiny, leaflet, plotly, and flexdashboard on the R side, and numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn in Python. Additionally, my background in history helps me bring a unique perspective, good research questions, and solid writing skills to my data science projects.

I am looking for a job at the moment, so if you are a potential employer interested in hiring me please reach out to me at my gmail address: carterwmcmahon. Thank you!
